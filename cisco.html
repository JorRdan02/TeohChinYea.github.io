            Module 2: Network Validation and File Transfer with Command Prompt</h2>
        <p>This module delves into the practical application of command prompt utilities to validate the connectivity of each device within the network. Through systematic checks, the module ensures the establishment of successful connections between devices, reinforcing the reliability of the network infrastructure.

            Furthermore, the module introduces File Transfer Protocol (FTP) as a means to efficiently exchange files between connected devices. Leveraging command prompt functionalities, users can seamlessly initiate and monitor file transfers, demonstrating the practical implementation of network protocols for efficient data exchange within the established network framework. This hands-on approach emphasizes the command-line proficiency and network management capabilities essential for robust and secure data communication.

        <h2> Module 3: File Verification with Command Prompt</h2>
        <p>This module is dedicated to the verification of successful file transfers within the network environment. Through the utilization of the command prompt's 'DIR' command, users can systematically inspect directories to confirm the presence of transferred files.

            By incorporating this meticulous file-checking process, the module ensures not only the initiation but also the successful completion of file transfers. This emphasis on verification aligns with best practices in network management, fostering a reliable and accountable file exchange system. The integration of the 'DIR' command exemplifies the commitment to thoroughness in monitoring and confirming the integrity of data exchanges within the network.</p>
